# Backend Developer Assignment Submission: KPA ERP API

**Submitted to:** Sarva Suvidhan Pvt. Ltd.

## Project Overview

This project is a complete backend implementation for the KPA ERP system as per the requirements of the backend development task. The primary objective was to develop two fully functional, diverse APIs from the provided collection, ensuring they adhere precisely to the specified request/response structures and seamlessly integrate with the provided Flutter frontend and a PostgreSQL database.

The application is built using Python with the FastAPI framework, emphasizing performance, code clarity, and modern development practices.

## Technologies Used

  * **Backend Framework:** Python & FastAPI
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Data Validation & Serialization:** Pydantic
  * **Database ORM:** SQLAlchemy
  * **API Server:** Uvicorn

## Implemented APIs

As required, two diverse APIs were selected from the SwaggerHub documentation to demonstrate proficiency in handling different HTTP methods and database operations.

1.  **`POST /api/forms/wheel-specifications`**

      * **Description:** Creates a new wheel specification record. This endpoint validates the incoming JSON payload and persists the data to the PostgreSQL database.
      * **Request Body:** Accepts a JSON object with `formNumber`, `submittedBy`, `submittedDate`, and a nested `fields` object, adhering strictly to the defined structure.
      * **Success Response:** Returns a `201 Created` status with a JSON object confirming the successful creation of the resource.

2.  **`GET /api/forms/wheel-specifications`**

      * **Description:** Retrieves a complete list of all wheel specification records currently stored in the database.
      * **Success Response:** Returns a `200 OK` status with a JSON object containing an array of all records.

## Bonus Features Implemented

This submission includes several bonus features to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modern backend development:

  * **Input Validation:** Robust input validation is handled automatically by FastAPI's integration with Pydantic, ensuring data integrity for required fields and data types.
  * **Environment-Based Configuration:** A `.env` file is utilized to manage the PostgreSQL database credentials securely, separating configuration from the codebase.
  * **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration:** Interactive API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI, providing a live, testable specification of the endpoints at the `/docs` route.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL.
2.  Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv` then `venv\Scripts\activate`).
4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the database URL:
    `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/kpa_db"`
5.  Install all required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6.  Run the application server: `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0`
7.  The API is now accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
